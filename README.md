# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST Dataset

This project demonstrates how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build, train, and evaluate a CNN model that can accurately classify handwritten digits. 
The goal is to achieve high accuracy on the MNIST test dataset by leveraging the power of deep learning with convolutional neural networks.

## Requirements

To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.x
    TensorFlow
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

## Results

After running the script, you can expect the model to achieve an accuracy of over 99% on the test set. 
The exact accuracy may vary depending on the training conditions and random initialisation.
