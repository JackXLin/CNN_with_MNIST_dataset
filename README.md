# Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) on MNIST Dataset

## Objective

This project demonstrates how to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using TensorFlow to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. 
The MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9.

## Requirements

To run this project with CPU only, you need the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.12.2+
    TensorFlow
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

To run this project with compatible GPU natively on Windows, you need the following dependencies installed:

    Python 3.10.14
    Tensorflow
    Cudatoolkit 11.2
    Cudnn 8.1.0
    NumPy
    Matplotlib

## Results

After running the script, you can expect the model to achieve an accuracy of over 99% on the test set. 
The exact accuracy may vary depending on the training conditions and random initialisation.
